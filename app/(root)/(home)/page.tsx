      <p>Welcome to Ease Your Mind</p>
      <p>The blog post where you can lose yourself in the world of gaming, movies, tv or projects that i am currently working on.</p>
      <p>The point is just relax and navigate your way to your choice of time wasting??</p>
      <p>I update this blog regularly so hit that star up in your navigation bar to keep up to date since as you can see its not an ideal domain name.</p>
      <p>I will be keeping you up to date with the games that I am playing, giving walkthroughs and reviews as well as any new movies that i see and giving you my opinion on them.</p>
